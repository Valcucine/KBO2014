## Description
This project aims to simplify the Meccanica kitchen, in order to make it even more smart and sustainable, both economically than ecologically.
Following the core concept of Meccanica, we decided to remove all the unnecessary components (such as hinges or doors) to enhance both the aesthetic and functional value of its modular steel structure.

It results a collection of fabric panels, washable and double faced, designed to “dress up” the kitchen. Four magnets placed at each of the corners (6 in
the longer version of the panel) allow you to attach each panel directly to the frame without the need for any other hardware component. This system ensures easy access to the the kitchen’s compartments without the constraints of normal doors. The panels can be opened vertically, horizontally or diagonally, and the magnets can stick along the whole structure.

The variety of choice and customization is almost limitless: the customer can choose which fabric to take and how to pair the two sides of the panel. Some examples may be: summer/winter; elegant/sporty; light/dark, and so on. You can also customize the chosen fabric by laser engraving, with patterns or images chosen by the customer. When necessary, the panels can be machine washed, or easily replaced. The customer could potentially have its own collection of kitchen clothes, changeable at will.

The benefits to the company are: avoid all the workings of the doors (milling, painting, finish); avoid all the hardware components; prevent the storage of huge amounts of wood for the doors; offer customers a highly personalized product; collaborate with leading textile suppliers such as Kvadrat, fashion houses and so on.
