The jorney of the water

project done during the Hackathon "Kitchen becomes open" By Valcucine

Recycle the cooking and vegetable washing water for various domestic purposes (gardening, cleaning, sanitary ware).

How it works in practice? The sink siphon is driven by two buttons. One to evacuate the soapy water, the other to collect the recycled water.

What do you need? A switch to split the soapy water and the recyclable water and a container.

How to distribute the water collected? The recyclable water collector is equipped with an electric pump.
