Take away
=========

## Description
When the research process was made, it was observed the importance of the connection of the kitchen with the food, in many levels from emotional to pragmatical.  
The result is a contemporary interpretation in the way that the food is stored, mixing an emotional and pragmatical connection embracing a sculptural solution. It is a shelve that becames a container, just by changing the material. It is used elastic fabrics to generate an hamac effect to store the food and objects, changing the surface. Also closing the concept, eventually the shelve becames a bag that you can “take away”.  
To produce it, it was generated a wooden frame into the existing meccanica shelve. Its is a double frame that adapts to the support of the shelving
system, occuping the same space as a wooden shelf. The wood and the textile is laser cutted, and assmebled easily with nails and double sided tape.
To use and support the middle of the shelf, the were addapted two supports to the existing frame, for an easy deploy of the bag.
