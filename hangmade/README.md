HANG-MADE
=========
ULTRA-ORDINAIRE<br/>

The whole idea of this project is based on the idea that Meccanica is a support to hold anything
people want to, or need to, in the kitchen of course, but also in all the spaces in which meccanica can
be used.<br />
We decided to draw a few hooks which people should be able to adapt to what they are looking for.
The shape of the hook can be the same to support a towel or a bike, but the size of it would of course
have to be adapted.<br />
Thinking of the development of 3d printing and the projection that maybe within a few years
everybody would be able to own a 3d printer at home, we kept these hanging tools as a database of
5 basic shapes in which users could just pick up the shape they need, transform it and print it by
themselves to use it the way they want to. Looking even further, we would love to picture people
sharing what theyâ€™ve made of the basic shapes with other users and help them improving the use
they can make of Meccanica.
